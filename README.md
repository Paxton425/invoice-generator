The *React Invoice Generator* is a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) designed to simplify the process of creating professional invoices. Built entirely with React and styled beautifully using Tailwind CSS, this tool allows users to dynamically add line items, calculate totals (including tax and discounts), and output the final document for printing or saving as a PDF.
